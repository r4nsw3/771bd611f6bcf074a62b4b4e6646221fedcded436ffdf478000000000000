  |   Shipped is an adorable party game where up to 8 players compete in    |
  |   sea skirmishes. Choose your favorite girl and navigate the sea.       |
  |   Your ship can't break, so first learn how to maneuver. With simple    |
  |   controls, it's easy to start but hard to master.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   To win, you must push your opponents to crash on land or out of the   |
  |   screen. Or just shoot them. To do that, grab ammo crates. If you're   |
  |   out of cannonballs, use your cannon and blow air to push enemies or   |
  |   deflect incoming fire. Remember to keep up with the movement of the   |
  |   camera - if your ship goes off-screen, it will instantly explode!     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With five different modes, you'll never get bored playing Shipped.    |
  |   If you're short on friends to play, you can always add                |
  |   AI-controlled players or try the challenging single-player arcade     |
  |   mode.                                                                 |
